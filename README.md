### Hey!

I'm an Android engineer you might know from writing two open-source libraries, [Graywater](https://github.com/tumblr/Graywater) and [Backboard](https://github.com/tumblr/Backboard). I'm currently focusing on ðŸ“· [photography](https://ericleong.me/photos/), but I'd love to help out with open-source projects!
